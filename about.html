    <p id="about_info">
        Founded in 2010 by master chocolatier Emma Latham, Heavenly Delights started as a small family business in 
        the heart of the countryside. Emmaâ€™s dream was to create chocolates that not only tasted exquisite but also
         embodied the love and care she poured into each recipe. With a commitment to quality and a passion for 
         innovation, our chocolates quickly gained a loyal following.</p>
